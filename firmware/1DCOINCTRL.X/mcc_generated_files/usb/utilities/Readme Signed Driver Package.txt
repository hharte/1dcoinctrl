This Driver package is signed, any modifications to this .inf file will
break the signature, and the driver package will need to be re-signed.

It is provided by Microchip Technology Inc. for the purposes of 
expediting development using a known signed driver. When developing your 
USB device, the VID and PID used in the PC side application program and 
the firmware on the microcontroller must match. The VID and PID can be 
changed using MCC to get a template .inf file.

For more information about the process refer to the document "USB - 
Obtaining a WHQL Certified USB Driver Package.pdf" also included as a 
part of this utilities folder.
